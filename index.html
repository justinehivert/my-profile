				<h1>Welcome to all of you !</h1>

				<p>
					My name is Justine Hivert, I am almost 20 years old and I am in my first year at IESEG. Let me introduce you to my school!

				<h2>To know myself a little better</h2>
				<p>
					I am of Corsican origin, I have 2 sisters and a dog. I am a very passionate and stubborn person (probably explained by where I come from). So I do things thoroughly or I don't do anything at all!
				</p>

			<div class="card-white">
				<h2>What I love about life</h2>
				<p>
					I have been lucky enough to travel a lot throughout my life and this has developed in me a real passion for foreign cultures. I love to learn new languages, new beliefs and new gastronomies and to discover new people.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card-white">
				<h2>Sporting side</h2>
				<p>
					I started playing basketball when I was only 4 years old, as I was born into a family of basketball players who put a ball in my hands at birth. I played this sport competitively until I was 16 years old. I love sports in general and I have been lucky enough to try out a lot of sports, but I think it would take a long time to list them all!
